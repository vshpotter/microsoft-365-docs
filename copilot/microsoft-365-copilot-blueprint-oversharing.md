# Address internal oversharing concerns in Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment blueprint

[Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-overview.md) works with different Microsoft services to help you get your data ready for Copilot.

For Copilot administrators, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. Existing administrators can also be unfamiliar with how some features can enhance their data security.

To address the need for shorter, actionable, and prescriptive guidance, you can use this deployment blueprint.

In this deployment blueprint, we provide a recommended approach to address internal oversharing concerns throughout a Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment.

The blueprint breaks the deployment into three phases:

- Pilot (optional)
- Deploy
- Operate

The blueprint provides:  

- An overview of the most common causes of internal oversharing in Microsoft SharePoint
- A recommended, staged approach to avoid oversharing in a Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment
- Recommended actions specific to E3 or E5 licenses at each stage
- Detailed guidance for using the tools in the SharePoint Admin Center, SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM), and Microsoft Purview to identify and mitigate oversharing and ongoing governance concerns.
